1.) 1.) The code sufficiently accurate. Confidently more than 90%.
2.) I'm not sure how to calculate the confidence interval.
3.)I'm not sure if my code can run mnist_1000, either that or the code takes too long?
4.)The changing the value of k did not have much of an effect on my results. This might happen because the data is very clustered and those clusters are very seperated. This might also happen if my k nearest neighbor is incorrect. I expected it to change even a little bit occasionally.
2.) This assignent felt relatively difficult. I enjoyed the assignment overall, finding k nearest neighbor was enjoyable. It was hard overall because I'm not sure if I was able to implement the code successfuly. I'm having it export the answers to a file, but I am not sure that it is correctly predicting based on k-nearest neighbor because whenever I change the value of k, it doesn't change the output (from what I've tested.) I'm not sure if it is because the data is just really clustered or if it is because it is not finding the nearest neighbor properly.
3.)11 hours
4.)I have adhered to the honor code.
