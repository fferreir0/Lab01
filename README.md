# knn
HW1: k-Nearest Neighbor

This assignment contains four data sets which are based on three publicly available benchmarks:

1. monks1.csv: A data set describing two classes of robots using all nominal attributes and a binary label.  This data set has a simple rule set for determining the label: if head_shape = body_shape  jacket_color = red, then yes, else no. Each of the attributes in the monks1 data set are nominal.  Monks1 was one of the first machine learning challenge problems (http://www.mli.gmu.edu/papers/91-95/91-28.pdf).  This data set comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MONK%27s+Problems
2. iris.csv: A data set describing observed measurements of different flowers belonging to three species of Iris.  The four attributes are each continuous measurements, and the label is the species of flower.  The Iris data set has a long history in machine learning research, dating back to the statistical (and biological) research of Ronald Fisher from the 1930s (for more info, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).  This data set comes from Weka 3.8: http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ and is also on the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris 
3. mnist_100.csv: A data set of optical character recognition of numeric digits from images.  Each instance represents a different grayscale 28x28 pixel image of a handwritten numeric digit (from 0 through 9).  The attributes are the intensity values of the 784 pixels. Each attribute is ordinal (treat them as continuous for the purpose of this assignment) and a nominal label.  This version of MNIST contains 100 instances of each handwritten numeric digit, randomly sampled from the original training data for MNIST.  The overall MNIST data set is one of the main benchmarks in machine learning: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.  It was converted to CSV file using the python code provided at: https://quickgrid.blogspot.com/2017/05/Converting-MNIST-Handwritten-Digits-Dataset-into-CSV-with-Sorting-and-Extracting-Labels-and-Features-into-Different-CSV-using-Python.html
4. mnist_1000.csv: The same as mnist_100, except containing 1000 instances of each handwritten numeric digit.
